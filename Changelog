Found data pipeline (ESPN hidden API) provides ats information in real time as well as matchup information and scores. Need to combine all functions into a single functions.py file for ease of use. Need to incorporate other predictor variables into the model and perform some kind of regression analysis to review performance retrofitting historical data and verifying predictability.

Produced a script that generates QBR for individual teams - need to be able to run for all teams at once and output to excel sheet. Later today will do an assessment of which tasks need to be prioritized.

Trying to figure out how to get the dataset formatted well. Filling zeros for teams with byes and NFC AFC. Removing repeated values if 2 qbs play for one week. Combined functions into one py script to export all data to an excel sheet. (Changes/notes that were put on readme file 8/17) 'As of 8/17 - Focusing on developing scripts that can seamlessly transmit predicting variables to an excel file to be imported to R Studio. Seamlessly enough to circumstantially produce datasheets that will be interpreted by R Studio week to week without interruption - fluctuating bye-weeks, AFC NFC mismatches, multiple inputs of a statistic when only one is expected, and all other unknown unexpected results - should be accounted for and blended into each pipeline.'

8/18
Solved bye week and AFC NFC issue with QBR data. Consolidated functions into one. Simplified excel export, but may want to explore how openpyxl interprets different objects - it has a nonintuitive way of delivering keys and tuple values to a dataframe separately. Using dictionaries homogeneously throughout future data retrieval functions will make formatting and exporting 10x easier. Also need to look deeper into Kirk Cousins / Mullen QBR selection and output. 

If this changelog stops being a changelog it's because I figured out how to use GitHub
