# NFL Betting Model
The goal of this script / function is to identify favorable week to week nfl spreads such that in the long term a sportsbettor will return a positive rate of return.
Machine learning may be a good course of action using prior seasons as testing samples. 
As of right now the script will utilize team momentum as the primary predictor variable. Teams that have two or more consecutive wins or losses against the spread will be considered as candidates week to week; determining whether the spread has adjusted sufficiently based on new information (game outcomes) may be considered as well.
